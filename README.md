# integral

Task is to write a program that will calculate the integrals as fast as possible. Use multiple threads for it, ideally a thread pool. The main goal is to compare how fast the calculation can be if we use multiple threads. Please check what amount of threads is optimal (try: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 threads).
